# Hangman and Word Chains
* Two projects I made while I initially started learning Ruby
  * Word Chains: Builds chain connecting two words where each step changes a single letter
  * Hangman

## Hangman
* Two modes: Human guesses word, computer guesses letters randomly
  * Computer guesses intelligently, narrowing down dictionary with every guess.

## Word Chains
* Implementation of [Word Chains RubyQuiz]["http://web.archive.org/web/20130215052516/http://rubyquiz.com/quiz44.html"].
